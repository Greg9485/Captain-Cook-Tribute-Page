			<p> Timeline of Capatin Cook's Voyages</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="text-align: left"> 1768–1771: First voyage – Endeavour 
					<p style="text-align: left">In 1768 James Cook was selected to lead a joint Admiralty-Royal Society expedition to the Pacific. This was part of the Royal Society’s plan to use the Transit of Venus (the passing of Venus across the face of the Sun) to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Joseph Banks, a wealthy landowner and botanist, also joined the voyage with a party of scientists and artists. Alongside the scientific aims, the Admiralty provided Cook with secret orders instructing him to search for land and commercial opportunities in the Pacific.<p>
				</li>
				<li style="text-align: left"> 1772–1775: Second voyage – Resolution and Adventure
					<p style="text-align: left">In 1772 James Cook was sent back to the Pacific by the Admiralty to search for the Great Southern Continent, believed by some in Europe to encircle the South Pole and to balance the weight of the landmasses of the northern hemisphere. The expedition circumnavigated the globe further south than had been done before, allowing Cook to rule out the existence of a continent ‘unless near the pole and out of reach of navigation’. Cook’s ships were the first to cross the Antarctic Circle and the Resolution set a record for the Farthest South that would stand for 49 years. During the voyage Cook also charted the location of several islands and island groups not previously plotted on European maps.</p>
				</li>
				<li style="text-align: left"> 1776–1780: Third voyage – Resolution and Discovery
				<p style="text-align: left">In 1776 Cook again sailed for the Pacific, this time with Admiralty instructions to search for a sea passage to the North Atlantic (known as the Northwest Passage), which would provide a new trade route from Britain. To conceal this strategic goal, the voyage was publicly presented as a mission to return Mai to his homeland.</p>
